# AtliQ Grand Hospitality Analysis
AtliQ Grand, a five-star hotel chain in India, has been facing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category due to increasing competition and ineffective decision-making. The management incorporated **Business and Data Intelligence** as a strategic move to regain their market position. However, they lacked an in-house analytics team, so they outsourced this task to gain insights from their historical data.

This project was completed as part of the **Codebasics Resume Challenge** and focuses on analyzing hotel performance across key metrics such as bookings, revenue, customer behavior, and ratings.
